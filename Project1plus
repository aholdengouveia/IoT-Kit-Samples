Blink

This was edited to have the lights blink one after the other on different pins then the original. This was to ensure I understand how to initialize lights in other places on the board, and also turn them on and off.

void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin 4 as an output.
  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
  //setup pin 7 with white light
    pinMode(7, OUTPUT);

}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(4, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(4, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second

  //same instructions but on pin 7 for the white light
    digitalWrite(7, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);              // wait for a second
